# windows-gamepad-off-center-deadzone-dll
This is a dll replacing to fix windows gamepad analog stick off center problem (stick drift) by implementing deadzone.

The files are win10 solution now.

You can compare them to see how to implement it on other windows version.

Or change the deadzone range if you want(it's 0...24 deadzone, full range is 0...128).

I don't have XBOX controller, so please let me know whether it works if you meet this requirement:)

Me happy.
